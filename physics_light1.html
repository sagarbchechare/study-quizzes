    "options": ["Curved lines", "Straight lines", "Zigzag lines", "Circular paths"],
    "answer": "Straight lines",
    "explanation": "Light travels in straight lines, which is called rectilinear propagation of light. This is why we see sharp shadows."

  },
  {
    "text": "Which material allows light to pass through it completely?",
    "options": ["Opaque", "Translucent", "Transparent", "Reflective"],
    "answer": "Transparent",

    "options": ["Plane mirror", "Glass prism", "Concave mirror", "Opaque screen"],
    "answer": "Glass prism",
    "explanation": "A glass prism can disperse white light into its constituent colors, forming a spectrum due to different angles of refraction for different colors."
  },
  {
    "text": "The image in a plane mirror is:",
    "options": ["Laterally inverted", "Vertically inverted", "Both laterally and vertically inverted", "Not inverted at all"],

    "options": ["Concave mirror", "Convex mirror", "Plane mirror", "Cylindrical mirror"],
    "answer": "Plane mirror",
    "explanation": "Most vehicles use plane mirrors as rear-view mirrors because they provide an undistorted image at the actual distance."
  },
  {
    "text": "Which property allows us to see objects?",
    "options": ["Objects emit light", "Light reflects from objects to our eyes", "Objects absorb all light", "Eyes emit light rays"],
    "answer": "Light reflects from objects to our eyes",

    "options": ["Violet", "Red", "Green", "Blue"],
    "answer": "Red",

    "text": "A periscope works on the principle of:",
    "options": ["Refraction", "Multiple reflections", "Dispersion", "Lateral inversion"],
    "answer": "Multiple reflections",
    "explanation": "A periscope uses two plane mirrors placed at 45° angles to reflect light twice, allowing us to see objects that are not in direct line of sight."
  },
  {
    "text": "When light enters from air to water, it:",
    "options": ["Speeds up", "Slows down", "Maintains same speed", "Stops completely"],
    "answer": "Slows down",

    "text": "The umbra region of a shadow is:",
    "options": ["Partially dark", "Completely dark", "Bright", "Colored"],
    "answer": "Completely dark",

    "text": "A sheet of glass is:",
    "options": ["Opaque", "Translucent", "Transparent", "Non-reflective"],
    "answer": "Transparent",
